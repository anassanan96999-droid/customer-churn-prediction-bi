"""Read-only SQL access to the analytical database, for the SQL Lab and the AI Copilot.

Three independent guards keep user- or LLM-written SQL harmless:
1. the database is opened read-only (SQLite `mode=ro` URI);
2. an authorizer rejects everything except reading (no writes, ATTACH, PRAGMA, ...);
3. a progress handler aborts runaway queries, and results are capped in rows.
